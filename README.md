This is part of the Mahjong App demo on VisionOS. The rest of the game development remain private.

This demo contains:
* Basic user interactions and 3D models.
* Winning hand table.
* Fan (i.e. pattern) calculation table.

We have had a hard time finding Mahjong related algorithm resources, so after careful research and our own game experience, this is the algorithm we developed (https://github.com/cublegend/MahjongTableConstructor). Hope this might help others who are also interested in Mahjong games.
