This is part of the Mahjong App demo on VisionOS. The rest of the game development remain private.

This demo contains:
* Basic user interactions and 3D models.
* Winning hand table. (The algorithm is here: https://github.com/cublegend/MahjongTableConstructor)
* Fan (yaojiu) table + Fan calculation algorithm.

We have had a hard time finding Mahjong related algorithm resources, so after careful research and our own game experience, this is the algorithm we developed. Hope this might help others who are also interested in Mahjong games.
